Development requires Node version 8 or higher as well as the React Native CLI (`npm install -g react-native-cli`)

To compile and test, you must have a *recent* edition of XCode or the Android SDK installed.

To install the dependencies required after cloning, do `npm install`.

Now you can install the client app on your connected emulator or device by running either `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.

The React Native debug client loads code from a "bundler" running on your local computer. The `react-native run-*` commands start this automatically for you. If you find yourself needing to run it manually, the command is `npm start`.
